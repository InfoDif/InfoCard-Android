<a name="1.2"></a><h2>1.2 Main Features</h2>

<p><b>Small overhead size</b></p>

<p>NSIS is created to be small, fast and efficient. While other installers often add hundreds of kilobytes or several megabytes to your installer data, a full featured NSIS installer has an overhead of only 34 KB.</p>

<p><b>Compatible with all major Windows versions</b></p>

<p>You can create a single installer that is compatible with Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista.</p>

<p><b>Unique compression methods</b></p>

<p>You can choose between three different integrated compression method (ZLib, BZip2, LZMA). The new LZMA compression gives better results than any other common compression method. You don't have to use large self-extracting archive modules or other applications. The compression support is included in the 34 KB overhead.</p>

<p><b>Script based</b></p>

<p>Unlike other systems that can only generate installers based on a list of files and registry keys, NSIS has a powerful scripting language. This script language is designed for installers and has commands that help you to perform many installation tasks. You can easily add custom logic and handle different upgrades, version checks and more. On the <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/wiki/">NSIS Wiki</a> you can find a lot more.</p>

<p><b>Multiple languages in one installer</b></p>

<p>One installer can support multiple interface languages. More than 40 translations are already included, but you can also create your own language files. RTL (right-to-left) languages such as Arabic and Hebrew are fully supported.</p>

<p><b>Many features and checks for the target system</b></p>

<p>The script language provides commands you can use on the target system. From simple features like folder creation and registry editing to text/binary file modification, modification of environment variables and system reboots. Using provided plug-ins you can even use Windows API.</p>

<p><b>Custom dialogs and interfaces</b></p>

<p>You can create custom wizard pages to get user input or integrate configuration options. NSIS includes a classic and modern wizard interface, but it is even possible to create your own custom interface.</p>

<p><b>Plug-in system</b></p>

<p>NSIS can be extended with plug-ins that can communicate with the installer. They can be written in C, C++, Delphi or another language and can be used to perform installation tasks or extend the installer interface. You can use the plug-in with a single line of script code. Plug-ins can also be compressed like other installation data and will only be included when you are using the provided features.</p>

<p><b>Support for web installation, file patching</b></p>

<p>The NSIS distribution includes a set of plug-ins that allow you to download files from the internet, make internet connections, patch existing files and more.</p>

<p><b>Project integration, different releases and automatic builds</b></p>

<p>The NSIS compiler features a powerful preprocessor. This allows you to easily integrate multiple projects into a single installer or automatically generate installer builds. You can also generate different releases such as lite and full version.</p>

<p><b>Easy and human readable file formats</b></p>

<p>The NSIS script format and the format used for interface dialogs are easy, documented and humanly readable, so you can edit your files with your favorite editor. This also makes automatic script generation possible.</p>
